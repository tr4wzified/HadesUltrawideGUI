# Hades Ultrawide Patch
This tool will patch Hades UI to work at 21:9. Do not use when you have a 16:9 screen.
Internally uses [Hephaistos](https://github.com/nbusseneau/hephaistos) by nbusseneau to patch the viewport, the (kinda messy) UI work was done by me.

To do:
- Prophecy Fulfilled Text + Icon
- Final boss fight fade-out fix
- Possibly main menu & loading screen, but the scaling here is very weird and multiple pictures are attached to each other which makes it very hard, would need to extract the pictures/animations
